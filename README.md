# RhythmicMatcher
Match touch input signals to a musical score


## Background
I once thought this rhythmic matcher was unnecessary--until I struggled with adding musical scores to my [Piano Conductor](https://github.com/lynnzye/pico) system, and I realized that this highlighted a common challenge in music creation: capturing and sharing abstract music ideas.

Many of us may be familiar with a song's melody or rhythm, but writing it down usually requires the use of abstract symbols (like key/time signatures, quarter notes, etc.). This process can be slow and unintuitive, compared to how naturally these rhythms and melodies feel when we think of them or hum along. 

..wait, there's a natural way to feel or show them? You got it. That's the idea behind this project, but here instead of singing it out, we tap it out. This project aligns tap signals to elements in a musical score. 

Offline alignment are usually more accurate than online tracking. 

But there are also benefits doing online tracking! Take a guess if you wish.
